# DivHacks2020
# CloseKnit Community

## Elevator Pitch
>We are an organization to help undergraduate and graduate students navigate their ways to achieve their dream degrees. Through our close-knit college communities, students have opportunities to not only contribute towards helping fellow peers but also to seek guidance regarding particular institutional courses and career advice. We hope to be a platform to allow you to engage with your community by lending a helping hand. This platform will allow you to post the questions that you may have regarding your university or career-wise, and another student in your community will be able to quickly answer your posts.

## What Inspired Us

>In these times, it is difficult to connect with other students in your college communities. We took an initiative to provide students an opportunity to engage with their peers through our platform and to answer any lingering questions or thoughts about their path to academic and career success.


### The Tools We Used
  - Flutter
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - Javascript
  - VS Code
  - Android Studio
  - GitHub
  - Git
  - Dart

## Development
>We divided different tasks to each teammate. Although we had a differing range of skill sets, we used that to our advantage. We combined both familiar and new languages and toolkits to create a website that is easy to use and available to the use of college students. By working as a team and helping one another solve the various challenges we ran into, we created our website.
##  Challenges We Faced
>An initial challenge we faced was determining which programming language and platform to build our website upon. After deciding to pursue Flutter as our framework and DART as our programming language, we had some trouble with the set-up and downloads. After this step, we were all learning how to use Flutter and DART because we had minimal exposure to it if any. Nevertheless, as we are currently in the midterm season, we had some time commitments, but we put in our best efforts to get as much of our vision turned into a reality.
## Login
>You may log into our website by mounting the website locally and logging in with the email 'test@test.edu' and password 'test' 

## What we learned
>Throughout this hackathon, we have learned lots of new, valuable knowledge that will help us significantly in our CS careers. In fact, this was the first hackathon for our team! We learned how to properly use GitHub as a resource to allow us to collaborate and easily access our work. In addition, we were introduced to Flutter and Dart, and we are excited to explore these tools further. We look forward to joining DivHacks in the upcoming years. 

## Whatâ€™s next for CloseKnit Community
>Due to time constraints, we have not fully implemented all that we would like to. Currently, we have a Columbia community, but we would like to expand this platform to all colleges and universities around the US. Furthermore, we would like to continue to better our user experience on our website and mobile application by implementing more features such as direct messaging and a search bar. Nevertheless, we have enjoyed bringing our vision to life, and we hope you feel the same.
