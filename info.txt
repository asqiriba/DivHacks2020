I'm a sophomore right now and we have to declare our majors soon, but I'm really torn between computer science and pre-med. I'm currently in AP and biology, and it's really difficult, but I am unsure of what to do. Is it possible to double major in these fields even though they are completely different? Please advice.

Hi, I am taking Art of Engineering right now, but I know that everyone says the class is easy, but I know we have a "final project" to do. What is this final project, and how can I start? How can I make a group?

I'm a senior right now majoring in computer science. I have a full-time offer as a Front End Developer, but I don't know if I should pursue more education. I feel like I have taken a lot of the master level coursework offered by Columbia. Is any current Master student in CS willing to have a chat to help me decide on what I should do?

Hi, I'm a freshmen, and I'm not quite sure where to study because my roommate in Wallach is usually on the phone, and I can't concentrate. Are there any good quiet places to study on campus?

Harry M, SEAS '23 @hmm3900 23 August
Hi Zeena! One of my favorite quiet places to study are the second floor of Noco (Northeast Corner Building). It is right next to Pupin Hall, and the library is to the left when you eat. The place part about this study spot is that the first floor allows you to quietly talk, but the second floor is complete silent. There is a coffee shop located in the building as well! Definitely worth checking out.

Noco is a great place to study but it usually is not open last midnight. If you are a nightowl like me, I recommend looking into Butler Library. Some of the rooms are very quiet, and it is open 24/7. There is so many places around campus though, and you could even study at Barnard. 

Zeena S, SEAS '24 @zes9182 24 August
Thanks guys! I appreciate it. Any ideas for how to book a study room?

Selena G, CC '22 @sg9837 28 August
You can login the columbia website and book a study room. It's hard to get a room near midterm season or near final exams, so I would try to book them in advance! Emailed the link to you.

Does anyone know what places I should visit first? 

Han R, SEAS '24 @hr9827 31 August
I'd go to the High Line and go to Grace Street and have their matcha beginets. 

Russel C, SEAS PhD, @russel.c17 28 September
You should most definitely go to Brooklyn and see the view during sunset. 10/10 recommend

Katherine R, CC '22 @kor8932 1 October
Jailyn, I would love to go with you! I am new to the City, and I'm down for an adventure :)

Jailyn Brown, Barnard '22 @jlb8237 1 October
Great!! I'm love you, I'll email you my number

How do I do research with a professor? I know it's typical to ask professors that you are familar with, but none of my professors are doing research that I am interested in.
